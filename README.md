# Description

Fetch new books and highlights from Readwise and print the results as markdown files in a chosen directory (i.e. Obsidian vault)

I'm a huge fan of [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and I hope this is helpful to others like me who wanted something a bit different than the basic markdown export (beta)

# Features

- Fetch all or subset of new books and highlights from Readwise (via their API https://readwise.io/api_deets)
	- Filter by custom `date from` or `last script run` date
- Group and sort highlights by book/article/podcast/tweet
- Create new markdown notes or append to existing ones in a chosen directory (i.e. Obsidian vault)
	- Filenames are formatted using [slugify](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/utils/)
	- Highlights with 'discard' tag are removed
	- Books with no highlights are ignored
- Markdown notes can be formatted, but default options are: 
	- Book metadata - in YAML format
		- Title
		- Author
		- Number of highlights
		- Last updated date - default format is "%Y-%m-%d" or "YYYY-MM-DD"
		- Readwise URL (e.g. link to readwise book)
		- Source URL (e.g. original article, tweet)
		- Cover Image URL
 	- Title - as a heading 1
	        - Last updated date (in Obsidian "%%" comments block) - default format is "%Y-%m-%d" or "YYYY-MM-DD"
 	- Highlight data
		- Text
		- Block reference ID - using the Readwise highlight ID as the unique block reference
		- Note
		- Tags - optional
		- References (e.g. original URL) 
- Store book and highlight data into JSON files for easy retrieval and manipulation
- Print outputs to the console and store in a log file for troubleshooting
- **NEW** Edit highlights in Readwise directly from a directory (e.g. Obsidian vault)

# Installation

- Clone this repo or download the ZIP folder and move to a chosen directory - this will serve as the `sourceDirectory` for running the scripts
	- Make sure the `readwiseCategories` folder is in the same directory as the `readwise-GET.py` script. This will store your JSON files.
- Configure the `readwiseMetadata.py` file:
	- Required
		- Add your token - https://readwise.io/access_token
		- Specify a valid `targetDirectory` path for your markdown notes (e.g. Dropbox folder, Obsidian Vault).
	- Optional
		- Customise the request query string - add a `dateFrom`, otherwise the `last script run` will be used (if available) or all highlights will be fetched
		- Customise the `dateFormat` and other note / highlight formatting fields
		- Add your `email` and `password`
		- Specify a `chromedriverDirectory` - instructions [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
- Install the Python modules specified in `readwise-GET_install.py` via [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)
- Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `sourceDirectory` (i.e. downloaded folder) - e.g. cd C:/Users/johnsmith/Downloads/readwise2directory-main
- Run the `readwise-GET.py` script
	- `py readwise-GET.py` (on Windows) or `python3.9 readwise-GET.py` (on Mac) 
	- Note: ~3 minutes to process ~1300 books, ~6200 highlights and ~2900 tags
